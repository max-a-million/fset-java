 * as the <code>java.util</code> classes that implement <code>Set</code>.  It does
 * not support the update operators declared by <code>Set</code> (which are
 * documented as optional, anyway); in their place it adds several new operators
 * which are "pure", in the sense that rather than modifying the set in place, they
 * construct and return a new set.
