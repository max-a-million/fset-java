/**
 * A map for which the update operators are all functional: they return a
 * new map rather than modifying the existing one.
 *
 * <p>Although this interface extends {@link Map} of the Java Collections Framework,
 * and thus is somewhat integrated into that framework, it is not used the same way
 * as the <code>java.util</code> classes that implement <code>Map</code>.  It does
 * not support the update operators declared by <code>Map</code> (which are
 * documented as optional, anyway); in their place it adds several new operators
 * which are functional, in the sense that rather than modifying the map in place,
 * they construct and return a new map.
 *
 * <p>Classes implementing <code>FMap</code> may also provide, corresponding to
 * each constructor, a static factory method <code>withDefault</code> which, in
 * addition to the functionality of the constructor, also allows the specification
 * of a default value to be returned by the <code>get</code> method when it is
 * called with a key which is not in the map.  (Otherwise, <code>get</code> returns
 * <code>null</code> in that case.)  This is particularly handy for map
 * <i>chaining</i>, in which the range values in one map are themselves maps.  For
 * example, if the outer map is created like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     FMap<K1, FMap<K2, V>> map =
 *         FTreeMap.<K1, FMap<K2, V>>withDefault(new FTreeMap<K2, V>());
 * </pre>
 *
 * the chained mapping <code>key1 -> key2 -> val</code> can then be added like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     map = map.with(key1, map.get(key1).with(key2, val));
 * </pre>
 *
 * which works even if <code>map</code> does not already contain an entry for
 * <code>key1</code>.
